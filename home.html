    <h1>HUMANS:</h1>
    human being, a culture-bearing primate classified in the genus Homo, especially the species H. sapiens. Human beings
    are anatomically similar and related to the great apes but are distinguished by a more highly developed brain and a
    resultant capacity for articulate speech and abstract reasoning. In addition, human beings display a marked
    erectness of body carriage that frees the hands for use as manipulative members. Some of these characteristics,
    however, are not entirely unique to humans. The gap in cognition, as in anatomy, between humans and the great apes
    (orangutans, gorillas, chimpanzees, and bonobos) is much less than was once thought, as they have been shown to
    possess a variety of advanced cognitive abilities formerly believed to be restricted to humans.

    Traditionally, humans were considered the sole recent representatives of the family Hominidae, but recent findings
    indicate that chimpanzees and bonobos are more closely related to humans than are gorillas and orangutans and that
    the last common ancestor between the chimpanzee and human lines lived sometime between seven million and six million
    years ago. Therefore, all great apes are now gathered with humans into Hominidae, and within that family humans and
    their extinct ancestors are considered to make up the tribe Hominini. See also Homo sapiens; human evolution.
    <h1>HUMANS EVOLUTION:</h1>
    Human evolution is the lengthy process of change by which people originated from apelike ancestors. Scientific
    evidence shows that the physical and behavioral traits shared by all people originated from apelike ancestors and
    evolved over a period of approximately six million years.

    One of the earliest defining human traits, bipedalism -- the ability to walk on two legs -- evolved over 4 million
    years ago. Other important human characteristics -- such as a large and complex brain, the ability to make and use
    tools, and the capacity for language -- developed more recently. Many advanced traits -- including complex symbolic
    expression, art, and elaborate cultural diversity -- emerged mainly during the past 100,000 years.

    Humans are primates. Physical and genetic similarities show that the modern human species, Homo sapiens, has a very
    close relationship to another group of primate species, the apes. Humans and the great apes (large apes) of Africa
    -- chimpanzees (including bonobos, or so-called “pygmy chimpanzees”) and gorillas -- share a common ancestor that
    lived between 8 and 6 million years ago. Humans first evolved in Africa, and much of human evolution occurred on
    that continent. The fossils of early humans who lived between 6 and 2 million years ago come entirely from Africa.

    Most scientists currently recognize some 15 to 20 different species of early humans. Scientists do not all agree,
    however, about how these species are related or which ones simply died out. Many early human species -- certainly
    the majority of them - left no living descendants. Scientists also debate over how to identify and classify
    particular species of early humans, and about what factors influenced the evolution and extinction of each species.

    Early humans first migrated out of Africa into Asia probably between 2 million and 1.8 million years ago. They
    entered Europe somewhat later, between 1.5 million and 1 million years. Species of modern humans populated many
    parts of the world much later. For instance, people first came to Australia probably within the past 60,000 years
    and to the Americas within the past 30,000 years or so. The beginnings of agriculture and the rise of the first
    civilizations occurred within the past 12,000 years.
    <h1>PALEOANTHROPOLOGY:</h1>
    Paleoanthropology is the scientific study of human evolution. Paleoanthropology is a subfield of anthropology, the
    study of human culture, society, and biology. The field involves an understanding of the similarities and
    differences between humans and other species in their genes, body form, physiology, and behavior.
    Paleoanthropologists search for the roots of human physical traits and behavior. They seek to discover how evolution
    has shaped the potentials, tendencies, and limitations of all people. For many people, paleoanthropology is an
    exciting scientific field because it investigates the origin, over millions of years, of the universal and defining
    traits of our species. However, some people find the concept of human evolution troubling because it can seem not to
    fit with religious and other traditional beliefs about how people, other living things, and the world came to be.
    Nevertheless, many people have come to reconcile their beliefs with the scientific evidence.

    Early human fossils and archeological remains offer the most important clues about this ancient past. These remains
    include bones, tools and any other evidence (such as footprints, evidence of hearths, or butchery marks on animal
    bones) left by earlier people. Usually, the remains were buried and preserved naturally. They are then found either
    on the surface (exposed by rain, rivers, and wind erosion) or by digging in the ground. By studying fossilized
    bones, scientists learn about the physical appearance of earlier humans and how it changed. Bone size, shape, and
    markings left by muscles tell us how those predecessors moved around, held tools, and how the size of their brains
    changed over a long time. Archeological evidence refers to the things earlier people made and the places where
    scientists find them. By studying this type of evidence, archeologists can understand how early humans made and used
    tools and lived in their environments.
